## Search Algorithms
## About:
Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the [search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. One of the applications of search algorithms include the [vehicle routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?". It generalises the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP).
